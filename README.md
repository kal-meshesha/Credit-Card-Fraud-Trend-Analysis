# Credit-Card-Fraud-Trend-Analysis
## Fraud Detection | Time-Series Analysis | Tableau &amp; Python | Risk Analytics
### Executive Summary

Financial institutions need to monitor fraud patterns to reduce financial losses and identify high-risk transaction behavior.

Using Python and Tableau, I analyzed credit card transaction data to explore fraud trends, detect patterns over time, and identify characteristics associated with fraudulent activity.

The analysis highlights fraud distribution patterns, transaction risk signals, and time-based trends that can support fraud monitoring and prevention strategies.

### Business Problem

Credit card fraud leads to significant financial losses and operational risk. However, raw transaction data does not clearly reveal:

When fraud is most likely to occur

How fraud compares to non-fraud transactions

Whether fraud patterns change over time

What transaction characteristics are associated with fraud

This project transforms transaction data into meaningful fraud insights.

### Methodology
#### 1. Data Preparation & Cleaning (Python)

Loaded transaction dataset

Checked for missing values

Validated fraud labels

Explored class imbalance between fraud and non-fraud cases

Created summary statistics for transaction amounts

#### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Compared fraud vs non-fraud transaction distributions

Analyzed transaction amounts

Examined time-based fraud trends

Identified anomalies and patterns

#### 3. Data Visualization (Tableau)

Built interactive dashboards

Visualized fraud trends over time

Compared fraud frequency by transaction characteristics

Highlighted high-risk periods

### Skills Used
#### Tools & Technologies

Python

Pandas

Matplotlib / Seaborn

Tableau

#### Analytical Techniques

Exploratory Data Analysis

Class Imbalance Analysis

Time-Series Trend Analysis

Risk Pattern Identification

Data Visualization

### Key Insights

Fraud cases represent a small portion of total transactions (class imbalance).

Fraud transactions show distinct distribution patterns compared to legitimate transactions.

Fraud occurrence varies over time, indicating possible behavioral or operational patterns.

Transaction amount patterns differ between fraud and non-fraud cases.

### Business Recommendations

Implement real-time fraud monitoring during high-risk periods.

Use transaction amount and behavioral patterns as risk indicators.

Develop predictive fraud detection models using identified patterns.

Prioritize anomaly detection for unusual transaction behavior.

### Next Steps

If given more time, I would:

Build a machine learning fraud detection model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest).

Apply SMOTE or other balancing techniques for class imbalance.

Perform feature importance analysis.

Deploy a fraud risk scoring system.

Create a live monitoring dashboard.

### Project Outcome

This project demonstrates the ability to:

Analyze financial transaction data

Detect fraud-related trends

Handle imbalanced datasets

Combine Python analysis with Tableau visualization

Translate analytical findings into risk mitigation strategies
